# Traffic Sign Classification - Convolutional Neural Network

## 1. Description

This project classifies Chinese traffic signs into one of the 58 categories. Based on Tensorflow CNN.

Currently supported traffic signs:

The model has four Convolutional Layers, followed by MaxPooling and three Dense Layers

## 2. Results

The model classifies the signs with 98% accuracy

## 3. Future Improvements

The dataset can be enriched with more types of signs, as well as modifying existing images by rotating/skewing them or just adding more data.
